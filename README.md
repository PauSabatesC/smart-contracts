## $PAU tokens

Total supply: 1000
No decimals bullshit, just 1000 coins, simple.

This is not a coin to scam or to welcome speculators, it's just the coin of Pau. 
Monetary speaking it's not worth a shit, but in the future there will be premium services created by Pau that will only accept $PAU or paying a lot in $ETH. 
So yeah, given the small amount of supply, if there is no more free supply this token can end up worthing a lot indirectly (if using my future services/projects).
